        Hitori Gotō, called Bocchi-chan by her bandmates, is extremely anxious and socially awkward. She longs to become
        a rock musician in spite of her struggles, while fulfilling her desires to one day make friends. She is suddenly

            <h3>Kessoku Band</h3>
            Kessoku Band (結束バンド, Kessoku Bando; lit. "zip tie", a pun on "unity band") is the central band in the
            series, based in Starry, a live house in Shimokitazawa. The members' family names are derived from the
            real-life J-rock band Asian Kung-Fu Generation, with their instrumental roles matching as well (for example,
            the Yamadas of both bands play bass). However, the guitarist roles of both Gotōs and Kitas are switched
            around, with Bocchi taking up lead compared to Masafumi's rhythm, and Ikuyo taking up rhythm compared to
            Kensuke's lead.

                        Hitori Gotō (<b>後藤 ひとり, Gotō Hitori</b>), nicknamed Bocchi-chan (ぼっちちゃん), is the main protagonist of
                        the series. She is a first-year high school student who plays guitar in Kessoku Band. She is
                        extremely anxious and socially awkward, but dreams of becoming a rock musician despite her
                        struggles. Her name "Hitori" means "alone" in Japanese, while her nickname "Bocchi" is a
                        colloquial term for being alone or lonely.

                        (<b>伊地知 虹夏, Ijichi Nijika</b>), The drummer and leader of Kessoku Band. Her older sister,
                        Seika, runs a live house where they often play. Nijika looks up to Seika, since they lost their
                        mother at a young age and their father disappeared. She's very kind, cheerful, friendly, and
                        outgoing, and she is the one holding the group together and helping Bocchi with her social
                        anxiety the most. Her surname comes from Kiyoshi Ijichi. She plays a Vintage Red Tama
                        Imperialstar drum kit.

                        Yamada Ryō (<b>山田 リョウ, Yamada Ryō</b>), The aloof, quiet, and mischievous bassist of Kessoku Band, who
                        has a cool demeanor and an androgynous appearance, to the point that she sometimes attracts
                        other girls (including Kita) without intending to. She often spends what allowance she gets from
                        her family on new music equipment, which leaves her with little money for anything else, to the
                        point of eating weeds when she has no money for food. After falling out with her last band over
                        creative differences, Ryo was convinced by Nijika to start a new one with her. Her surname comes
                        from Takahiro Yamada. She plays an Olympic White Fender Precision bass.

                        Ikuyo Kita (<b>喜き多た 郁いく代, Kita Ikuyo</b>), The vocalist and rhythm guitarist of Kessoku Band, who
                        attends
                        the same high school as Hitori. In contrast to Hitori, she is a cheerful, charismatic extrovert
                        who has an active social life, to the point that her extroversion manifests as an overwhelming
                        aura at times. She initially joined Kessoku Band to get closer to Ryo, whom she has a crush on,
                        but fled after lying about her guitar-playing skills. With Bocchi's help, she becomes a decent
                        guitar player in her own right and soon settles on playing secondary guitar and providing the
                        band's main vocals. She refers to herself as Kita Kita due to her strong dislike of her given
                        name,[a] which causes her to have a Bocchi-like meltdown when discussing it. Her surname comes
                        from Kensuke Kita. She plays a Pelham Blue Gibson Les Paul Junior Doublecut electric guitar.
